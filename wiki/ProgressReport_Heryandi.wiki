==Browser Selection==
We have chosen to implement our own plugin on Google Chrome browser. The reason for choosing this browser is because we are able to temporarily disable Google Chrome's anti-XSS protection (XSSAuditor) by using the command:
{{{
chrome.exe --args --disable-xss-auditor 
}}}

This is a very important feature to test our plugin. If the XSSAuditor is enabled, we will not know which of XSSAuditor and our plugin is responsible for blocking the script.

Disabling anti-XSS protection is, as far as we know, not possible in Mozilla Firefox.
